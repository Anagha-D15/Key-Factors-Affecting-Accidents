# Key-Factors-Affecting-Accidents
This project analyzes factors like traffic, fines, weather, and road conditions affecting accidents in urban and rural areas using Tableau and SAS. It uses visualizations and predictive models (Decision Tree, Regression, Neural Network, Random Forest) to find trends, compare accuracy, and suggest ways to reduce accidents.

## INTRODUCTION
Traffic accidents are one of the critical global issues that cause property damage, injury, 
and fatality. Now a days, with urbanization and the rise of car usage, especially in 
developing countries, the need to identify accidents causing factors has become the need. 
Urban areas often struggle with a lot of traffic jams because of too many vehicles, on the 
other side rural areas had bas road quality and weak enforcement on traffic rules. 
This study uses the dataset from Kaggle to find out the different factors like traffic density, 
road conditions, weather and how people drive. By using data analysis tools like tableau 
and SAS, we hope to find patterns that are not easy to see just by looking at it. By 
comparing accidents in cities and in rural areas, we can help create better plans and 
solutions to make roads safer in both places.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT: 
Despite safety initiatives, traffic accidents still happen because of many connected factors 
like weather, design and how people drive cars. The goal of this project is to look at how 
different things such as rain or traffic fines affect accidents as it is not clear what exactly 
influences the number of accidents majorly. Understanding which things really cause 
accidents can help make better safety rules, as the factors might not have the same impact 
in the cities compared to the countrysid
